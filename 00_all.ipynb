    "The first step is to load the source documents that will be used to augment the language model's knowledge\n",
    "This could be done by reading files from disk, pulling from a database, scraping web pages, etc.\n",
    "The goal is to get the raw text content into a format that can be further processed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Chunking/Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Long documents need to be broken down into smaller chunks that are a manageable size for embedding and retrieval\n",
    "Common approaches include:\n",
    "  * Fixed-size chunking - split text into equal sized chunks based on character or token count \n",
    "  * Semantic chunking - split based on semantic boundaries like sentences, paragraphs, or sections\n",
    "  * Hierarchical chunking - create chunks at multiple levels of granularity\n",
    "The ideal chunk size depends on the embedding model, retrieval use case, and downstream task\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Embedding & Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "* The text chunks are converted to vector embeddings using a model like Upstage embeddings\n",
    "* The embeddings are indexed and stored in a vector database to enable efficient similarity search \n",
    "* Metadata about the source chunks can also be stored alongside the embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "* At query time, the user's question is itself embedded as a query vector\n",
    "* The query embedding is used to find the most similar document chunks in the vector index \n",
    "* Top-k most relevant chunks are retrieved and can be used to augment the prompt sent to the language model to generate an answer"

      "Bug classification is a process that involves categorizing software bugs based on their characteristics, such as their severity, the component of the software they affect, or the type of error they represent. This process helps developers and quality assurance teams to prioritize and manage bugs more effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bug classification process typically works as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identification**: The first step in bug classification is to identify the bugs in the software. This can be done through various methods, such as testing, code reviews, or user feedback.\n",

      "   - **Component**: Bugs are often categorized based on the component of the software they affect. For example, a bug might be classified as a UI bug, a database bug, or a server-side bug.\n",
      "   - **Type**: Bugs can also be classified based on their type, such as logic errors, memory leaks, or security vulnerabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prioritization**: After bugs have been classified, they are prioritized based on their severity and other factors, such as their impact on the user experience or the business goals of the software. This helps developers to focus their efforts on the most critical bugs first.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Documentation**: The classified bugs are then documented in a bug tracking system, such as Jira or Bugzilla. This documentation includes information about the bug, its classification, and its status, which helps other team members understand the bug and its impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Resolution**: Developers work to fix the bugs, and once they are resolved, the bugs are marked as closed in the bug tracking system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bug classification is an important part of software development and quality assurance. It helps teams to manage and prioritize bugs effectively, which can lead to better software quality and a better user experience.\n"

    "\n",
    "![Overview](./figures/a_in.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The code demonstrates a smart Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines local retrieval with external search capabilities. The main goal is to provide relevant context for answering user questions by first searching a local vector database and then falling back to an external search service if the local context is insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code defines two main functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. is_in: Determines whether the answer to a given question can be found within the provided context.\n",
    "smart_rag: Retrieves relevant context for a given question, either from the local vector database or an external search service, and generates an answer using the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. The code uses the LangChain library for generating prompts and invoking language models, as well as the Tavily API for external search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code starts by defining the is_in function, which takes a question and context as input and determines whether the answer to the question can be found within the context.\n",
    "    * It defines a prompt template called is_in_conetxt that asks the language model to check if the answer is in the context and return \"yes\" or \"no\".\n",
    "    * The prompt template is used to create a ChatPromptTemplate object.\n",
    "    * A chain of operations is constructed using the | operator:\n",
    "      * The ChatPromptTemplate is passed to the ChatUpstage model.\n",
    "      * The model's output is parsed using the StrOutputParser.\n",
    "    * The chain is invoked with the question and context, and the response is stored in the response variable.\n",
    "    * The function returns True if the response starts with \"yes\" (case-insensitive), indicating that the answer is in the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code then demonstrates the usage of the is_in function with two example questions and their corresponding contexts retrieved from a retriever.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Next, the code defines the smart_rag function, which takes a question as input and generates an answer using the retrieved context.\n",
    "    * It first retrieves the context for the question using the retriever.invoke method.\n",
    "    * If the is_in function determines that the answer is not in the retrieved context, it falls back to searching for additional context using the Tavily API.\n",
    "    * The retrieved context (either from the local retriever or Tavily) is stored in the context variable.\n",
    "    * A chain of operations is constructed using the | operator:\n",
    "      * The rag_with_history_prompt (not shown in the code snippet) is used as the prompt template.\n",
    "      * The prompt is passed to the llm language model.\n",
    "      * The model's output is parsed using the StrOutputParser.\n",
    "    * The chain is invoked with the conversation history, retrieved context, and the question, and the generated answer is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finally, the code demonstrates the usage of the smart_rag function with two example questions:\n",
    "    * \"What is DUS?\": The answer is expected to be found in the local context.\n",
    "    * \"What's the population of San Francisco?\": The answer is not expected to be found in the local context, so it falls back to searching with Tavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code showcases how LangChain can be used to build a smart RAG system that combines local retrieval with external search capabilities. By first searching a local vector database and falling back to an external search service if needed, the system aims to provide relevant context for generating accurate answers to user questions."

    "## Custom Tools in LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code demonstrates how to create custom tools in LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models. Tools are essential components in LangChain that allow language models to perform specific tasks or access external resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code defines three custom tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `add`: A tool that adds two integers.\n",
    "2. `multiply`: A tool that multiplies two integers.\n",
    "3. `get_news`: A tool that retrieves news articles on a given topic using an external API.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools are then bound to a language model using the `bind_tools` method, enabling the model to utilize these tools when generating responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the code and explain each part in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing necessary modules:\n",
    "   - `tool` from `langchain_core.tools`: This module provides the `@tool` decorator for defining custom tools.\n",
    "   - `requests`: A library for making HTTP requests to external APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Defining the `add` tool:\n",
    "   - The `@tool` decorator is used to define the `add` function as a custom tool.\n",
    "   - The function takes two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.\n",
    "   - The docstring provides a brief description of the tool's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Defining the `multiply` tool:\n",
    "   - Similar to the `add` tool, the `multiply` function is defined as a custom tool using the `@tool` decorator.\n",
    "   - It takes two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their product.\n",
    "   - The docstring describes the tool's purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Defining the `get_news` tool:\n",
    "   - The `get_news` function is defined as a custom tool using the `@tool` decorator.\n",
    "   - It takes a `topic` parameter of type `str` and returns news articles related to that topic.\n",
    "   - The function constructs a URL for the news API using the provided topic and an API key stored in an environment variable.\n",
    "   - It sends a GET request to the API using the `requests` library and returns the JSON response.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Creating a list of tools:\n",
    "   - The `tools` list is created, containing the `add`, `multiply`, and `get_news` tools.\n",
    "   - This list will be used to bind the tools to the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Binding the tools to the language model:\n",
    "   - The `bind_tools` method of the `llm` object is called, passing the `tools` list as an argument.\n",
    "   - This step binds the custom tools to the language model, allowing it to utilize these tools when generating responses.\n",
    "   - The resulting object is assigned to the variable `llm_with_tools`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The code demonstrates how to create custom tools in LangChain, which can be used to extend the capabilities of language models. By defining tools for specific tasks, such as mathematical operations or retrieving news articles, developers can enhance the functionality of their LangChain applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@tool` decorator simplifies the process of defining custom tools, while the `bind_tools` method allows seamless integration of these tools with the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging custom tools, LangChain enables developers to build powerful and versatile applications that can perform a wide range of tasks beyond simple text generation.\n"
