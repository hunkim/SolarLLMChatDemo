Reasoning: 1. Understand the problem: We need to find the probability of getting a sum of 11 when rolling a die three times.
2. Calculate total possible outcomes: A die has 6 faces, so for each roll, there are 6 possibilities. For three rolls, the total possible outcomes are 6^3 = 216.
3. Identify favorable outcomes: List all combinations of rolls that result in a sum of 11. There are 18 such combinations.
4. Calculate probability: Divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total possible outcomes: 18 / 216 = 1/12.
5. Conclusion: The probability of getting a sum of 11 when rolling a die three times is 1/12.

Example 5:

Instruction: Rewrite the below text (which is a fragment of a longer script for the video). Fix grammar and other errors and make it sound more professional.

Networks and security, or how to connect the digital world. How can we exchange data quickly and efficiently. There are different types of networks.
A local area network (LAN) is for smaller, more local networks - home, business, school, etc.
A wide area network (WAN) covers larger areas such as cities and even allows computers in different countries to connect.
An intranet is a private enterprise network designed to support an organization's employees in communicating, collaborating, and performing their roles, usually to the exclusion of outside access.
We also have the well-known internet, which is the largest network connecting computers around the world.

But of course someone could try to intercept that communication. And we want to securely exchange data. We want to find vulnerabilities and defend against hackers.
This is why we have something like cryptography. It is a field of study that focuses on the encoding and decoding of info using special algorithms. So only the sender and receiver can know the content of the message.
There are many ways to protect your data, programs, devices and networks. Besides cryptography, we also use antivirus programs that can check if anything looks suspicious. A very popular trend is also the use of artificial intelligence to defend against hackers. But hackers can also use AI to attack. So it's a double-edged sword. None

Reasoning: 1. Read and understand the original text.
2. Identify grammar and other errors.
3. Determine the main points and concepts.
4. Rewrite the text to fix errors and improve professionalism.
5. Ensure all important information is included and clear.
6. Check for factual accuracy and potential confusion.
7. Finalize the revised text and present it as the output.

Example 6:

Instruction: How many even perfect square factors does $2^4 \cdot 7^9$ have? None

Reasoning: 1. I need to find the number of factors of $2^4 \cdot 7^9$ that are both even and perfect squares.
2. A factor of $2^4 \cdot 7^9$ must be of the form $2^a \cdot 7^b$, where $0 \leq a \leq 4$ and $0 \leq b \leq 9$.
3. To be even, a factor must have $a > 0$, since $2^0 = 1$ is odd.
4. To be a perfect square, a factor must have both $a$ and $b$ even, since an odd power of a prime is not a perfect square.
5. I need to count how many ways I can choose $a$ and $b$ to be even and positive.
6. For $a$, I have two choices: $2$ or $4$.
7. For $b$, I have five choices: $0, 2, 4, 6, 8$.
8. So the total number of choices is $2 \cdot 5 = 10$.

Example 7:

Instruction: If the city council maintains spending at the same level as this year' s, it can be expected to levy a sales tax of 2 percent next year. Thus, if the council levies a higher tax, it will be because the council is increasing its expenditures. Which one of the following exhibits a pattern of reasoning most closely similar to that of the argument above?
A: If the companies in the state do not increase their workers'wages this year, the prices they charge for their goods can be expected to be much the same as they were last year. Thus, if the companies do increase prices, it will be because they have increased wages.
B: If newspaper publishers wish to publish good papers, they should employ good journalists. Thus, if they employ poor journalists, it will not be surprising if their circulation falls as a result.
C: If shops wish to reduce shoplifting, they should employ more store detectives. Thus, if shops do not, they will suffer reduced profits because of their losses from stolen goods.
D: If house-building costs are not now rising, builders cannot be expected to increase the prices of houses. Thus, if they decrease the prices of houses, it will be because that action will enable them to sell a greater number of houses. Choose A, B, C or D as your solution.

Reasoning: 1. Identify the pattern of reasoning in the given argument: If X remains constant, Y can be expected to be Z. If Y is not Z, it's because X has changed.
2. Analyze each option to find a similar pattern of reasoning:
   A: If X (workers' wages) remains constant, Y (prices) can be expected to be Z (the same as last year). If Y is not Z, it's because X has changed (increased wages).
   B: This option discusses a cause and effect relationship (employing good journalists leads to good papers) but does not follow the same pattern of reasoning.
   C: This option also discusses a cause and effect relationship (employing more store detectives reduces shoplifting) but does not follow the same pattern of reasoning.
   D: This option has a different pattern of reasoning: If X (house-building costs) remains constant, Y (house prices) cannot be expected to increase. If Y decreases, it's because of a different reason (selling more houses).
3. Option A follows the same pattern of reasoning as the given argument.
4. Choose A as the solution.

Example 9:

Instruction: If z = arctan(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}), what's the derivative of $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$ at x = 0.
Relevant Theorem: The Derivative Chain Rule is a fundamental rule in calculus used to find the derivative of a composite function. A composite function is a function that is formed by combining two or more functions, where the output of one function becomes the input of another function.

The Chain Rule states that if you have a composite function, say h(x) = f(g(x)), then the derivative of h(x) with respect to x, denoted as h'(x) or dh/dx, can be found by taking the derivative of the outer function f with respect to the inner function g(x), and then multiplying it by the derivative of the inner function g(x) with respect to x.

Mathematically, the Chain Rule can be expressed as:

h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)

or

dh/dx = (df/dg) * (dg/dx)

The Chain Rule is particularly useful when dealing with complex functions that involve multiple layers of functions, as it allows us to break down the problem into simpler parts and find the derivative step by step. None

Reasoning: 1. Identify the given function: z = arctan(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2})
2. Recognize that this is a composite function, with an outer function (arctan) and an inner function (e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}).
3. Apply the Chain Rule to find the derivative of z with respect to x: dz/dx = (d(arctan)/d(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2})) * (d(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2})/dx)
4. Find the derivative of the outer function (arctan) with respect to the inner function (e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}): d(arctan)/d(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}) = 1/(1 + (e^{1 + (1 + x)^2})^2)
5. Find the derivative of the inner function (e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}) with respect to x: d(e^{1 + (1 + x)^2})/dx = e^{1 + (1 + x)^2} * 2(1 + x)
6. Combine the derivatives from steps 4 and 5 using the Chain Rule: dz/dx = (1/(1 + (e^{1 + (1 + x)^2})^2)) * (e^{1 + (1 + x)^2} * 2(1 + x))
7. Simplify the expression: dz/dx = (2(1 + x) * e^{1 + (1 + x)^2}) / (1 + e^{2(1 + (1 + x)^2)})
8. Evaluate the derivative at x = 0: dz/dx = (2(1 + 0) * e^{1 + (1 + 0)^2}) / (1 + e^{2(1 + (1 + 0)^2)})
9. Simplify and calculate the numerical value: dz/dx = (2 * e^2) / (1 + e^4) â‰ˆ 0.3017
10. The derivative of z with respect to x at x = 0 is approximately 0.3017.

Example 10:

Instruction: What is the largest number $c$ such that $2x^2+5x+c=0$ has at least one real solution? Express your answer as a common fraction. None

Reasoning: 1. I need to find the largest value of $c$ for which the quadratic equation $2x^2+5x+c=0$ has at least one real solution.
2. To do this, I'll consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is $b^2-4ac$.
3. The equation has at least one real solution if and only if the discriminant is non-negative, so I want to maximize $c$ subject to the constraint that $b^2-4ac\geq 0$.
4. In this case, $a=2$, $b=5$, and $c$ is the unknown, so I have $5^2-4(2)c\geq 0$.
5. Simplifying, I get $25-8c\geq 0$.
6. Adding $8c$ to both sides, I get $25\geq 8c$.
7. Dividing both sides by $8$, I get $\frac{25}{8}\geq c$.
8. This means that $c$ can be any number less than or equal to $\frac{25}{8}$, but the largest possible value of $c$ is $\frac{25}{8}$ itself.
